# Summary

To render content on different device screen resolutions there are different strategies. Modern web design gives us three options to use: Responsive, Adaptive, and Standalone Design, although standalone has fallen into disuse because of the overhead it comes with to maintain multiple codebase and their development lifecycle hence, we would just be focussing on Adaptive and Responsive.

1. Responsive - Make the content fluid so it'll render based on the available space
2. Adaptive - Make content targeted for specific screen sizes so it'll render exactly like that, regardless of the available space.

This RFC will focus on what approach and strategies we shall take in our Design System.

Modern web design gives us three options to use: Responsive, Adaptive, and Standalone Design, although standalone has fallen into disuse.

# Basic Example

### Responsive Modal

üëáüèª An example of a responsive design where we have modal which is responsive to the screen size and has a `maxWidth` defined for it to render on larger screen sizes, where on smaller screen sizes(mobile) it'll take `100%` of the width of the screen.

<br/>

### Adaptive Search Field

üëáüèª An example of a adaptive design where we have two implementation of search field.

1. Larger Screen Size - Search Input with Autosuggestion
2. Smaller Screen Size - Search Field when clicked opens up a full screen modal which basically gives an optimised search experience on smaller screen size.

# Motivation

### Why are we doing this?

As of today, we don't have any strategy or approach in place for designing layouts for different screen sizes. Ensuring that elements fit within a page is not enough. There are different experiences that works for different screen sizes.

Just going Responsive(Fluid) Design blindly is not correct. Imagine for example, you have different experiences(styles, javascript) for mobile vs desktop but if you just go blindly with responsive we might be unnecessary download assets for all the screen sizes our application would run on. For example it doesn't makes sense to implement [this Search Field](#adaptive-search-field) as a responsive layout since it'll result in unnecessary download of the assets(modal for mobile) and hence hampering the experience and performance for the consumers.

Similarly, just going adaptive blindly is not correct too. We might unnecessary be creating redundant variant of the same component. For example, imagine that we are creating 2 variants of a modal - 1 for desktop(which has a width of `600px`) and 1 for mobile(which has `100%` width). Now we could have just made it responsive by setting the `maxWidth` property of the modal so it could have been `600px` in width on desktop and `100%` in width on mobile. For eg, it doesn't makes sense to create multiple variant of [this Modal](#responsive-modal) while we can achieve this through responsive layout by setting `maxWidth` for Modal's Dialog component.

But because we don't have these strategies in place we don't know how to approach building layouts and components for different screen sizes.

### What use cases does it support?

- Handling responsiveness internally in the components based on different screen sizes.
- Layout components that will help you define different layouts based on screen sizes.
- Rendering different variants of a component based on screen sizes, optimising for performance without bloating the bundlesize.

### What is the expected outcome?

We'll basically define the approach and strategy we'll be taking in Blade to build components that will address the concerns of rendering based on different screen sizes.

# Detailed Design

## Responsive Design

- Responsive is fluid and adapts to the size of the screen no matter what the target device. Responsive uses [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to change styles based on the target device such as display type, width, height, etc., and only one of these is necessary for the site to adapt to different screens.
- Ensuring that elements fit within a page is not enough. For a responsive design to be successful, the design must also be usable at all screen resolutions and sizes.
- Since images and other high bandwidth features are simply scaled down rather than resized or eliminated outright(unless added some lines of JS which again degrades the performance and increases the mess in code), elements which may not be vital to user experience can cause poor performance.

### Pros and Cons of Responsive Design

| Pros                          | Cons                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abundance of templates to use | Elements can move around fluidly                                       |
| Often easier to implement     | Longer mobile download times.                                          |
|                               | Tons of `@media` queries often leads to a maintenance overhead in code |

## Adaptive Design

- While responsive design relies on changing the design pattern to fit the real estate available to it, **adaptive design** has multiple fixed layout sizes. When the site _detects_ the available space, it _selects_ the layout most appropriate for the screen. So, when you open a browser on the desktop, the site chooses the best layout for that desktop screen, resizing the browser has no impact on the design.
- Adaptive works to detect the screen size and load the appropriate layout for it ‚Äì generally you would design an adaptive site for six common screen widths(confirm with Saurav once on exact sizes we are doing and update):
  - 320
  - 480
  - 760
  - 960
  - 1200
  - 1600
- Because adaptive allows for a different experience between the mobile and desktop versions, products that want to deliver a different experience for their mobile customers can do so without sacrificing quality in either version. It can also be tacked on to an existing site, whereas responsive layout requires rewriting all the original HTML code in the back end.
- There was a [case study by Catchpoint](https://www.catchpoint.com/blog/responsive-vs-adaptive) in which they selected 15 examples each of Adaptive and Responsive websites out of the Alexa Top 100 rankings (US), and tested the response times to see how the greater amount of data in responsive sites leads to higher latency. Unsurprisingly, the mobile response times showed a significant variance between Adaptive and Responsive sites.

## What would work for us?

As you saw there are pros and cons to each of the approach so we can't abandon either of them but we need to strike a strategy where each of these approaches will work best.

After doing some research and aligning it with our uses cases at Razorpay, I propose following things at a broader level.

### 1. Components that can handle Responsiveness Internally

- Most of the components that don't deal with layouts shall handle responsiveness internally. For eg: Button, Modal, Avatar, Select, etc.

- The properties that affects responsiveness are:

  - `width`
  - `height`
  - `font-size`
  - `padding`
  - `margin`

- While a lot of [well known design systems gives flexibility](#approaches-taken-by-well-known-design-systems) on every component for above properties to accept responsive values, I can't think of a use case why would it make sense for us to give that flexibility. Majority of the cases that I could think of wouldn't be any different if the consumers define the values for them explicitly. So seems like we'll be adding unnecessary learning curve to the component's API.

  - For eg: all the props(ones that are affected by responsive) for a component will then accept either single value or array/object of values for different screen sizes which is confusing and might lead to a lot of confusions on the API surface

    ```jsx
    <Text fontSize="100" />

    <Text fontSize={{ small: 100, medium: 100, large: 100, xl: 400 }} />
    ```

- Hence the idea here is that all these components except the Layout components will handle responsiveness based on predefined breakpoints internally without the consumers explicitly defining anything for them.

### 2. Components that can give some flexibility to handle Responsiveness to consumers

- While most of the components can handle responsiveness internally there are use cases for components where we would need to give flexibility to accept responsive values for certain props. For eg: Layout Components that handles the overall layout of the page might change the layout on different screen sizes based on the available space.
  <img alt="Adaptive Layout with flex direction" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-flex-direction.png">
- The idea here is to have certain components that deal with Layout of the page expose some flexibility to consumers to tweak if they want the layout to look different on different screen sizes

### 3. Components for Adaptive layout(rendering components conditionally)

- After handling responsiveness internally and also giving flexibility for few scenarios there are still few complex cases that we need to handle:

  - There are cases where we might need to render a completely different variation of a component based on the screen size and user experience. For eg: A Search Field component might be different for larger screen sizes and smaller screen sizes.
    <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-search-field.png">

  - Another example is to show and hide certain elements based on the screen size so that we can optimise for user experience for each screen size
    <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-multiple-layouts.png">

- The idea here is to make it feasible for consumers to handle these kind of complex use cases with ease, maybe with a set of predefined components and APIs.

## How will we actually implement the approaches discussed above?

- talk about conditional rendering when we have different versions all together to render.
  - talk about lazy loading in this case

To begin with, as a first step we will first need to setup different screen sizes that we'll support(this is agnostic of whether we go responsive vs adaptive).

- 320
- 480
- 760
- 960
- 1200
- 1600

- talk about token level scale for different screen sizes
- talk about no Scale(up/down) in between a screen size. for eg: if mobile is the category then we won't change things after that so the content will be same for a lower screen resolution and high screen resolution for mobile devices.
  - shed the light that we have things in `rems` so this won't be a problem and things will work fine.
- define what approach will we take when
- talk about responsive props
- talk why would handling internally makes more sense in most cases except layout components.

- talk about React Media

# Drawbacks/Constraints

Why should we _not_ do this? Maybe try to consider the following constraints

- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity.
- The impact of it on new as well as existing consumer projects.
- Cost of migration.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs/patterns/strategies have been considered?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing consumer projects adopt it?

- Is this a breaking change?
- Can we write a codemod?
- How do we prioritise this with business and product folks?
- How do we communicate with other teams? Will updating docs suffice or do we need a dedicated interaction with them?

# How do we educate people?

- How should this be taught to other folks?
- What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why?
- How is this idea best presented?

# Open Questions

- Any open questions that you have?
- Any undiscovered areas that you have encountered?
- Any dependencies on other teams(Design/Engineering) that needs to be resolved upfront?
